It can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andyczhao/covidx-cxr2. It is a continually growing dataset with 30,882 chest X-rays involving 17,026 patients as of this writing.\n",

Performance on the entire dataset was only at 81.6 AUC compared to the original which was at 86.9 AUC, and is consistently lower for other dataset percentages than the original paper. However, the performance of the ConVIRT-based model still demonstrated a learning boost, largely confirming the impact of the ConVIRT contrastive learning strategy. For example, accuracy was shown to be much better on RSNA with just 1% of the data using ConVIRT compared to 100% of the data using ImageNet, and this was observable across all data subsets. \n",
